            <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine crushed Biscoff cookies and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan, making sure it is evenly distributed. Bake for 10 minutes and then remove from the oven. Let it cool while you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar together until smooth and creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract and Biscoff spread until well combined. 
</li>
<li>Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth out the top with a spatula. Bake for 60-70 minutes or until the cheesecake is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. Turn off the oven and let it cool inside for another hour. Then remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature before refrigerating for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
<li>In a medium mixing bowl, whip heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract together until stiff peaks form. Spread the whipped cream over the top of the chilled cheesecake. Garnish with crushed Biscoff cookies before serving.</li></h3>
